Using disjunctive normal form to form any logic statement in Lightning Network payments


Let x, y be scalars and be considered TRUE, if revealved and FALSE if not. A payment is paid from Alice (A) to Bob (B) depending on any boolean logic represented by the disjunctive normal form between these two variables.

The disjunctive normal form consists of multiple terms of ANDs connected with ORs. For every state of the boolean variables where the formula is TRUE, the variables x0, x1, x2, ... are connected with ANDs so that the term is TRUE only in this case. Hence, two different terms are never TRUE at the same state. 

Every term is represented by one or two Lightning payments.
